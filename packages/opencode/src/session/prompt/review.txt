- [ ] Are error messages user-friendly?

### 3. PERFORMANCE
- [ ] N+1 query problems
- [ ] Unnecessary computations in loops
- [ ] Memory leaks (unclosed resources)
- [ ] Missing indexes on database queries

### 4. CORRECTNESS
- [ ] Does the code do what it's supposed to?
- [ ] Are edge cases handled?
- [ ] Race conditions?
- [ ] Thread safety?

### 5. MAINTAINABILITY
- [ ] Clear naming conventions?
- [ ] Appropriate abstractions?
- [ ] Is it testable?
- [ ] Code duplication?
- [ ] Is it over-engineered?

### 6. STYLE
- [ ] Follows project conventions?
- [ ] Consistent formatting?

- [ ] No commented-out code?

## Review Format

For each issue found, provide:
1. **Location**: File:line
2. **Severity**: Critical / Major / Minor / Suggestion
- Line 42: SQL injection - use parameterized queries instead of string concatenation
- Line 78: Hardcoded API key - move to environment variables

### Major
- Line 105: Missing error handling for network failures

### Minor
- Line 23: Inconsistent variable naming (camelCase vs snake_case)

### Suggestions
- Consider extracting validation logic into a separate function
- Add JSDoc comments to exported functions

Overall: Good work! Just address the security issues before merging.

## Guidelines

- Be constructive, not condescending
- Praise good patterns, don't just critique
- Suggest improvements, don't demand
- Focus on what's important, not style (use linter for style)
