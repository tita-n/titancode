Read a file or directory from the local filesystem. If the path does not exist, an error is returned.

## Usage

- The filePath parameter should be an absolute path.
- By default, this tool returns up to 2000 lines from the start of the file.
- The offset parameter is the line number to start from (1-indexed).
- To read later sections, call this tool again with a larger offset.
- Use the grep tool to find specific content in large files or files with long lines.
- If you are unsure of the correct file path, use the glob tool to look up filenames by glob pattern.
- Contents are returned with each line prefixed by its line number as `<line>: <content>`. For example, if a file has contents "foo\n", you will receive "1: foo\n". For directories, entries are returned one per line (without line numbers) with a trailing `/` for subdirectories.
- Any line longer than 2000 characters is truncated.
- Call this tool in parallel when you know there are multiple files you want to read.
- Avoid tiny repeated slices (30 line chunks). If you need more context, read a larger window.
- This tool can read image files and PDFs and return them as file attachments.

## Best Practices

1. **Start from the beginning**: Always read files from line 1 unless you specifically need a later section.
2. **Use offset for large files**: If a file is 1000+ lines, read in 200-line chunks rather than tiny slices.
3. **Read related files together**: When understanding a feature, read all related files in parallel.
4. **Check imports first**: To understand a file, start by reading the imports at the top.

## Examples

```
# Reading a configuration file
Input: package.json
Output: Shows all 2000 lines starting from line 1

# Reading with offset for large files
Input: path: "/src/main.ts", offset: 100
Output: Shows lines 100-2099 of main.ts

# Reading multiple files in parallel
Input: [path: "/src/app.ts", path: "/src/config.ts", path: "/src/utils.ts"]
Output: All three files returned in one response
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Don't use `cat` command in bash - use Read tool instead
- Don't read files line-by-line in a loop - read larger chunks
- Don't guess file paths - use glob to find them first
