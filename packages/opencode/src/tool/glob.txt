Fast file pattern matching tool that works with any codebase size.

- Supports glob patterns like "**/*.js" or "src/**/*.ts"
- Returns matching file paths sorted by modification time
- Use this tool when you need to find files by name patterns
- When you are doing an open-ended search that may require multiple rounds of globbing and grepping, use the Task tool instead
- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively perform multiple searches as a batch that are potentially useful.

## Patterns

* = any characters in one directory
** = any characters recursively
? = single character

## Examples

src/**/*.ts = all TS files in src
**/*.test.{js,ts} = all test files
*config*.{js,json,yaml} = config files
